# OmniText: The All-in-One NLP Text Analysis Tool üìù
## üí° Overview
OmniText is a comprehensive and intuitive web application built with Streamlit for effortless Natural Language Processing (NLP). It provides a complete suite of tools to analyze, summarize, and understand any body of text. Whether you need to quickly grasp the main points of a long document or extract key information from a web article, OmniText has you covered.

## ‚ú® Features
1. **Intelligent Text Summarization**: Condense lengthy articles into a few key sentences. Choose from a variety of advanced algorithms, including LSA, LexRank, Luhn, and TextRank, and customize the summary length to fit your needs.

2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Automatically identify and categorize important entities within your text, such as PERSONS, ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, and DATES. A visualizer highlights these entities, and a frequency chart shows the most common ones.

3. **URL Text Extraction:** Simply paste a URL, and OmniText will scrape the main content from the web page for analysis, making it easy to work with online articles and blog posts.

4. **Sentiment Analysis:** Get an overall sentiment score for your text, classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral.

5. **Word Cloud & Frequency Analysis:** Visualize the most frequently used words in your text with a dynamic word cloud and a bar chart, helping you quickly identify the main themes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: The primary framework for building the interactive and user-friendly web interface.

- **spaCy**: A powerful library for high-performance Named Entity Recognition.

- **sumy**: A versatile library that provides various unsupervised text summarization algorithms.

- **TextBlob**: Used for performing simple and effective sentiment analysis.

- **Requests & BeautifulSoup**: Essential libraries for extracting text from web pages.

- **WordCloud & Matplotlib**: For generating insightful data visualizations.
